# Morse-Code-using-FSM
This project implements a Morse Code translator using a Finite State Machine (FSM) to decode sequences of dots (.), dashes (-), and pauses into alphanumeric characters. The FSM processes input signals in real-time, with state transitions representing partial Morse sequences and pauses triggering character evaluation. Short pauses separate characters, while long pauses indicate word boundaries. Designed for modularity and clarity, the implementation offers a structured approach to signal interpretation, making it an excellent educational tool for learning FSM concepts, Morse code decoding, and basic signal processing. This repository includes complete source code, examples, and detailed comments for easy understanding and extensibility.
